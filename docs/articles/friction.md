#Introduction to Friction

Friction is the resistance to motion of one object moving relative to another.
> This is the fundamental idea of how friction develops. The rest of this article will sound like a physics lesson because it is. You may never use the physics behind friction in high school robotics, but understanding how the concepts and equations work can prove helpful.

Terminology:
- _Coefficent of Kinetic Friction_ - The constant that determines the friction between two surfaces that are moving
- _Coefficent of Static Friction_ - The constant that determines the force required to make an object that is in contact with another object move relative to the latter object
- _Normal Force_ - The force that two objects are applying on one another
> This is not necssarily what the normal force is, it is just a simplification of the term to be applied with friction.

The _Coefficents_ are determined experinmentallyt and are unique to materials. It is uncessary to know the exact value in trying to understand what friction is occuring in your robot unless you are trying to find the exact valuee for friction.

Force of Friction = _Coefficent of Kinetic Friction or Static Friction_ x _Normal Force_

To understand friction, lets first think of a joint conisting of two pieces of metal tightened down with a single screw. When you first push together on the bars, you will feel that its pretty hard to get the two pieces of metal moving but once you do, the joint becomes quite loose. What you experiuences when you applied a force (in this case your arm strength) and before the joint began moving was called _Static Friction_ which is the hardest type of friction to fight. The force of static friction is equal to whatever force you apply to it, making it hard to bypass. To figure our how much force you need to apply to bypass static friction, you will use the equation:

Force of Friction = _Coefficent of Static Friction_ x _Normal Force_

This is also known as the breakaway point or just breakaway

After you made the joint move, it is much easier to move it back and forth and your arms can relax a little. You are now experiencing _Kinetic Friction_ (Friction that occurs when two objects are moving)

The force of kinetic friction can be found by using the equation:

Force of Friction = _Coefficent of Kinetic Friction_ x _Normal Force_

The force of _Kinetic Friction_ will ALWAYS be lower than the force required to reach breakaway.

#Takeaway

What this means for you is that once your joint is in motion, it will face less friction but to get the joint in motion, you will need a higher force than to keep it in motion
