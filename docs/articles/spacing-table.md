# Common Spacing Distances - Documented!

Remember to use a [Spacing Calculator](articles/external.md?id=spacing-calculator) in conjunction with this info, to really speed up the spacing process on the fly!

### Inward-facing, Cross-braced
This configuration is for when 2 C-channels are joined by another channel or plate running across, and the C-channels are facing eachother. This is the distance on the inside, between the faces.

`Distance(inches) = (CrossLength - 1) * 0.5 - 0.6`

| CrossLength (# holes) | Distance (inches) |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 3                     | 0.4               |
| 4                     | 0.9               |
| 5                     | 1.4               |
| 6                     | 1.9               |
| 7                     | 2.4               |
| 8                     | 2.9               |
