Friction
 ========
 
 Introduction
   ------------
 One of the basic concepts of physics, friction is essential to how the world works, and after reading this guide you will find out just how essential it is to making your robot work. Knowing where to locate and how to reduce friction is key to maximizing the efficiency of your bot, and this skill helps increase your team's overall build quality. 

 What is friction?
   --------------------
 Put your hands against one another. Now try rubbing them. Feel the heat generated? That heat is a direct result of friction. When your hands are still, they are experiencing static friction, or the inherent force that any object must overcome when touching another surface. When you move your hands, they are experiencing what is known as kinetic friction, or the force that resists an object when it is moving. During the building process, it is important to ask yourself: Do I want friction here? Now the answer for this question differs in regards to what you are building. If your are building a joint, such as a lift, then you want to minimize friction. However, if you are building a drive, you generally want to increase the friction between the wheels and the ground, or the traction, and make your drive stable.

 Reducing Friction
   -----------------
 There are many ways to reduce friction on your robot, especially in crucial parts, such as the lift and drive. Let's take a look at some of the most common and efficient techniques.
 
   ###Limiting Metal on Metal Contact
     One of the easiest ways to limit friction is by reducing the amount of contact between two metal surfaces. This can be achieved by making thorough use of nylon spacers. By putting a nylon spacer between two c-channels on a lift, you drastically reduce the energy lost in the heat generated due to friction. Even one teflon washer can greatly contribute in decreasing friction. Additionally, make sure to use a proper amount of spacers and bearings to eliminate slop. This also helps reduce friction. However, when using spacers and bearings to eliminate slop, make sure to leave just a washer's worth of slack. Although this will reduce a small amount of stability, the loss of friction is worth the trade-off. This technique is especially useful on the drive train, as it helps your wheels rotate smoothly.

   ###Using a Lubricant
     Sometimes, adding a few drops of bike oil in your motor greatly increases the efficiency of the component. You can try applying it to your axles and the motor internal themselves. However, before using this method, make sure you follow all VEX regulations, as certain substances might not be allowed. Lithium grease, however, is permitted on your axles and gears,as long as it doesn't mess up the tile or get applied on other robots.

   ###Reducing the Usage of Gears and Sprockets
      For every inclusion of a gear and a chain and sprocket system, a motor loses its efficiency in gears. Thus, when desigining your robot, pay specific attention to trying to limit the overall usage of the two. It is also important to consider when it is more sensible to use gears vs sprockets. Chain and sprocket have a greater affect on a motor's efficiency as compared to gears. However, in areas where power has to be transferred over long distances, such as the drive, it is smarter to use chain, rather than using multiple gears.

 Increasing Friction
   -------------------
   Although uncommon, there are certain scenarios that may require you to increase friction. Examples of this are on a locking mechanism, where you want your lock to experience more resistance. You can do this by doing the opposite of everything above. Instead of eliminating metal on metal contact,try increasing it. Space tightly, and don't use a lubricant. Certain wheels,such as the high traction wheels made by VEX, also help increase your robot's grip on the ground.
