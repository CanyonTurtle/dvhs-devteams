# Version Control

Have you ever lost changes you made to a file?

Have you ever tried to work with a friend on a project where you both have to edit the same file, WITHOUT google docs?

Have you ever wished you could go back, control-z, but you already closed and opend the file so you can't?

Have you ever accidentally deleted something really important?

Chances are, you can solve all of these problems at once, with version control. 

# Using Git

Git solves 2 fundamental challenges for us that we can apply to ROBOTC:
1. having organized versions so that different versions can be accessed at any time.
2. Share versions with others in a safe, predictable way, so there is 0% chance of losing work.

# Read Up!

The topic of version control and git are so large that an adequate explanation should be saught at the source:

By the end of reading the above, make sure you understand the following:
- why version control is important
- what is a commit
- how do branches in git work
- what is a repository

# GitHub vs Git

Simply put, GitHub is a place where Git repositories go. GitHub is a website, git is a program.

In robotics, we will use GitHub to store ROBOTC projects online. This makes it easy for everyone to contribute.

Repositories on GitHub.com are **remote repositories** - that is, they are stored on a server. When you want to use the code from a remote repo, you must get a local copy of the repository.
