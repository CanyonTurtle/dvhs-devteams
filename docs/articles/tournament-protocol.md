# Tournament Protocol

Congratualations! You made it to tournament day and its time to show off the hard work you have done to make an amazing robot.

What a VEX Robotics Competition Tournament is:
- Compete in the VEX Robotics Challenge and the VEX Robotics Skills Challenges
- Make connections with other teams
- Learn building strategies, robot strategies or match strategies from watching and taking notes of other matches
- Learn from mistakes or victories of your and other's robots to improve your own robot or strategies
- Presenting your robot judges and being able to answer questions about your robots

What a VEX Robotics Competition IS NOT:
- A time to rebuild your entire robot. After losing a match, you may be tempted to make a major change, hold off on that and just take notes on what you wanted to to do, There are many more matches and tournaments to come but the tournament is not the time to rebuild your robot.
- A place to copy robots. Do not go around taking close up picture of other robots with the intent to copy. Make sure to ask the team first if its okay as directly copying an idea can be frustrating for a team that puts in a lot of time and effort developing something. 

# Assigning Tournament-Day Roles
A VRC Tournament has alot of moving parts. It will be huge advantage to teams if they plan roles for the day **beforehand**.

Here's a list of roles that need to be fulfilled on the path to winning in competition and in judging awards.
- [ ] (2) Inspection crew: will take the robot to the inspection table at the beginning of the day. Also, turns in the engineering notebook.
- [ ] (1) Registration person: will make sure the team picks up the registration packet, and signs up for judging awards / skills runs if applicable.
- [ ] (3) Pre-match checkers: will review the robot before every match to make sure everything is right (batteries charged **and plugged in correctly**, screws in place, joystick has OK batteries, team has goggles etc...)
- [ ] (3) Driving team: the three people (max) who will show up to drive or coach the matches. Pre-match checkers + driveteam is a good idea to double up roles.
- [ ] (1) Queue Watcher: will update the team on when matches are about to happen, when the skills feild is ready, when judges are coming around, etc...
- [ ] (1) Presentation person: facilitates the judging presentation setup and makes sure everyone is ready to present.
- [ ] (1) Battery person: makes sure batteries are charging (safe mode for qualification matches, fast mode for elimination matches is what we at DVHS usually do).

> Make sure your team has an IM platform to communitcate on tournament day: Messenger, Discord, Slack, etc...
