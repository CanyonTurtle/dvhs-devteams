# Tournament Protocol

Congratualations! You made it to tournament day and its time to show off the hard work you have done to make an amazing robot.

What a VEX Robotics Competition Tournament is:
- Compete in the VEX Robotics Challenge and the VEX Robotics Skills Challenges
- Make connections with other teams
- Learn building strategies, robot strategies or match strategies from watching and taking notes of other matches
- Learn from mistakes or victories of your and other's robots to improve your own robot or strategies
- Presenting your robot judges and being able to answer questions about your robots

What a VEX Robotics Competition IS NOT:
- A time to rebuild your entire robot. After losing a match, you may be tempted to make a major change, hold off on that and just take notes on what you wanted to to do, There are many more matches and tournaments to come but the tournament is not the time to rebuild your robot.
- A place to copy robots. Do not go around taking close up picture of other robots with the intent to copy. Make sure to ask the team first if its okay as directly copying an idea can be frustrating for a team that puts in a lot of time and effort developing something.
