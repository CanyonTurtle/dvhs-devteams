The Judges Presentation
=======================

Introduction
------------
The Excellence award is one of the most prestigious awards in any Vex Robotics Tournament. The teams that earn it have successful robots, a good skills score,a solid Engineering Notebook, and a well-given presentation. As such, this guide will help you understand the basics of creating a solid presentation.

The Gist of It
--------------
  The main purpose of a presentation is to explain your thought process to judges who know nothing about your team. Essentially, you have to take every decision you made for the past couple of months, and condense it into 5-10 minutes worth of content. And make it somewhat entertaing. Don't worry- it's not that hard!

The General Outline
-----------
  The general format that most teams follow goes like:
    1. Introduction
    2. Mentorship/Community Outreach
    3. The Mechanical Aspect of the Robot
    4. The Programming Aspect of the Robot
    5. Strategies
    6.The Engineering Process
    7. Ask for questions/Conclusion

  Keep in mind that this order is completely arbitrary, with the exception of the introduction and conclusion of course. However, make sure that if any of these aspects are appplicable to your team, you include them.

 Introduction
------------
   When giving/rehearsing your presentation, remember that your first impression is your last impression. Thus, make sure that you are making eye contact, and try shaking the judges hand. And remember to smile! The judges are as tired as you, so try to look as enthusiastic as possible! As far as content goes, simply introduce every team member and thier respective roles on the team. Finally, introduce your team and robot. When introducing your team, be sure to discuss the various roles your team takes on to help with the efficient dynamic. As a guideline, your team may follow the standard build, programming, and documentation teams. Being one of the sections in the Design Award rubric, judges want to see how your team has divided its resources to ensure optimal performance. If you decide to adopt this technique as one of your slides, be sure to mention that the roles are nuanced; members may fall under multiple areas so that everyone understands the robot in equal fashion.

 Mentorship/Community Outreach
-----------------------------
   A huge part of robotics is ensuring that your team follows good dynamics and that you make an effort to help your community with your knowledge. And if your team is proactive in attempting these tasks, include it in your presentation. Try to explain how the older, more experience members on your team educate the younger, amateur members. Judges like to see how your team's chemistry works, and this is an amazing oppurtunity to display that. Additionaly, if your team plays an active role in helping spread your collective knowledge to the community, state that. STEM education is always great!

 The Robot
---------
   This is it. This is your chance to explain all of the hard work you put in, in the past months. However, you have to put all of it in around 5 minutes worth of time. To start, break your robot into two aspects, mechanical and programming.

 The Mechanical Aspect
---------------------
    A way to make the process easier is breaking your robot into different, key parts. For example, during the In the Zone season, my team's robot was split into a few crucial parts: The drive, the mobile goal lift, the main lift, the top lift, and the claw. After you break your robot apart, figuratively of course, try to explain the thought behind each parts' design. Ask yourself- Why did we use a 4-bar? Why did we use a tank drive? When you can answer these questions, make a short paragraph and include it with a picture/CAD of that part. Repeat this process for all the parts, and before you know it, you will be finished!

 The Programming Aspect
----------------------
    Much like the process for the mechanical aspect, split apart your programming into different parts. Many programmers choose to explain drive code, autonomous, special codes, and skills differently. But from there, you can continue to ask yourself questions, in a fashion similar to the one showed above. With programming however, you can go one step further, and illustrate the path your robot takes during autonomous and skills.

 Strategies and The Engineering Process
--------------------------------------
   Perhaps the most crucial part of your slideshow, this section allows you to explain your analysis of the game and how it coincided with the famous Engineering Process. The content here should include your mindset, regarding the game, and how you can best create your robot to score maximum points. Keep in mind that all this relates to the Problem-solving cycle, and this relationship should be your main point of emphasis.

 Presenting and Practicing
------------------------
   About a couple days before the tournament, it is a good idea to bring your team together, and rehearse your presentation. This familiarizes everyone with their part, and allows you to understand the time frame you are working in. During these practices, the main focus should be on understanding your part, and using proper speaking skills, such as tone and eye contact.

 Flex on them!
-------------
   Everything stated above is the basic skeleton of a team's presentation. However, many teams that win Excellence frequently tend to have certain unique attributes, that set them apart from other contendors. If your team has the skill and the time, here are some things you may want to consider adding:

   - Computer Aided Designs of your robot
   - Gifs of your auton/skills
   - Efficiency Calculations
