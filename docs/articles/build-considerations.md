# General Design and Build Considerations
 ==========


 # Foreword

 This guidance comes directly from the experiences of VRC Competitive Team members. If you don't want to consider anything,that's fine. After all, 3 weeks of work can save you 3 hours of planning (that's a joke).

# Mechanical Considerations

* [ ] Think about the game with your team and plan on paper instead of going straight to building once the game is released.
* [ ] Make prototypes of robot subsystems to test if the concept could work.
* [ ] Don't rebuild major portions of the robot the night before a tournament.
* [ ] Think about how different subsystems will interact with each other spacing and sizing wise.
* [ ] Place the cortex in a way that is easy to access the power switch.
* [ ] Put battery mounts so that the weight is low to the ground, and so the batteries are easy to change.
* [ ] Do all sizing checks before the tournament and with the official VEX sizing tool.
* [ ] Delegate tasks to other teammates or be proactive. There is ALWAYS something that needs to be done whether it be sorting parts, working on presentation, planning match strategies, prototyping other designs, etc. Take breaks as needed by use your time WISELY. The tournament is usually sooner than you think it is!
* [ ] Do not stick to one design the entire season. Consider or prototype other designs even if you are doing well with your current robot.

# Software Considerations

# Tournament Considerations

* [ ] Read the game manual. Everybody should know it cover to cover and should also know that the manual is updated frequently. Check the updates and game rulings on VEX Forums.
* [ ] Create a checklist of tools, parts, and boxes you took to the tournament. You will save money if you bring back whatever you took to tournament. Parts have a tendency to disappear or got misplaced at tournaments.
* [ ] Pack the car the night before.
* [ ] Designate a parent to be at the tournament for food/snack runs or emergency part/tool runs.
* [ ] Create a parent driving schedule beforehand.
* [ ] Get everybody's numbers and contact information beforehand. You don't want to be looking for somebody if you cant find them and don't have their number.
* [ ] Do not charge batteries on fast setting unless you are in elims. It will cause batteries and robot performance to be inconsistent. 
* [ ] Bring extension cables and power bars. There are never enough outlets for all teams.
* [ ] Each member should have a responsibility at the tournament before hand. Examples include: Drive team, coach, "pit crew", battery runner, presentation organizer, match schedule reminder, scouting and other team interaction, photo/video and match watcher.
* [ ] Watch matches, you will learn a lot from other team's experience and will help you build match strategy.
* [ ] Talk to other teams, you can learn from them and build connections so that when it comes alliance selection you know how their robot is or you are at the top their minds.
* [ ] Practice Gracious Professionalism.
