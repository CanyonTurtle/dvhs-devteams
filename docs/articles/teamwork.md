# Teamwork
> Simply put: Prioritize your teammates!

This article provides a couple basic guidelines to working as part of a team. Working as part of a team is a challenge: everyone has feelings, everyone has good and difficult days, and everyone is, well, human. Because of this, it is necessary to have good team manners and to always try to show respect to your teammates.

This advice is not specific to Robotics at all - teamwork is teamwork.

# Make-Space, Take-Space
An important part of good peer-to-peer teamwork is understandind how your teammates work together, and how you fit into that. Are you the reserved one, who seldom shares ideas, or the outgoing one, who feels comfortable talking the most about everything?

It is best to be yourself. If you are tending to be shy or outgoing, that is totally fine and acceptable. The important thing is, recognize where you fall, so you can be aware in teamwork about making sure everyone gets the chance to get their ideas into play. 

If you know you are the talkative, outspoken one, then **make space**. This could mean asking for opinions of other not-so-outspoken members, reserving comments until later so teammates have the chance to talk first, or anything you see fit to give others the chance to contribute. If this is you, remember: maybe not everyone feels comfortable enough sharing out all the time!

On the other hand, if you know you are more reserved in commenting, **take space**. This means you will take more opportunities to share, and not let your ideas go unheard. 

# Discussing Ideas Politely
The important thing to remember about discussing ideas is that people's feelings and thier ideas about a robot are **both** important to understand. For example, consider the impact of saying "that's silly, it would *never* work. We should do ... instead". You might be right, but that will hurt someone's feelings, and you didn't say *why* it wouldn't work.

Now consider instead saying "I think that it's important to consider ... and by that logic, I think it's better to do ... instead". The difference here is that the speaker is *aknowledging their opinion is not a fact*, and they are *providing reasoning behind their point of view*. They are also being *considerate of others' feelings* because the dialog is worded in a polite, focused way. Also, the speaker provides an alternative idea here - offering your own solutions is important if you are going to propose something.

> Remember Intent Vs. Impact - you may *intend* to mean something, but are really responsible for the **impact** of what you say. That's why trying to be polite and respectful is important.

Here are some sentance stems that you can abide by to facilitate constructive discussions:

> Remember: it is perfectly ok to disagree. But the way you express your disagreement is important!

This is very important to grasp. expressing ideas politely is a skill that must be developed. If you make an effort to be polite and considerate in discussions, it will come through in the respectful relationships you will develop with your teammates. 

# Be the Example
If you want your team to be better in a certain way, make it start with you! no need to wait. A positive example is very powerful; if you show resilience and dedication in being an example, it will pay off! That is a gurantee.
