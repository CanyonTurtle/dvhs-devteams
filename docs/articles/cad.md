# Intro - What is CAD?

Computer Assisted Design (CAD) is a tool for designing in 3D on a computer. By using CAD, a robot design can be created out before anything is built.

# Setting Up CAD with Autodesk Fusion 360

1. Visit the Autodesk site and to [download Autodesk fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/inventor-professional). Make sure you pick Fusion 360, not Inventor! You will need to login or make an account with your dh email.

2. Once Fusion 360 is installed, ask a mentor to invite you to the club project.
3. Once invited, your account will have access to a complete CAD software and all the parts you need to build VEX robots in Fusion 360!

# Learn the Basics of CAD

Fusion 360 will provide a help system, complete with tutorials on how to make sketches and designs (both technical terms by the way).

# Tips

- Don't do spacing with spacers / axles yet! spacers should be last or even ignored; the CAD software will allow you to align joints without them.
- ALWAYS un-link parts you bring in - this will give you more access to them.
- Saving a part that is also being used in another design (aka a `parent`) will give you an option in the other design to update the reference to the part. That is, until you un-link. Just be aware of the relationship between parts!

# Make a Robot

Make a `new design` in Fusion 360. Now you can open the parts on the left, drag them in, move them, and start linking them together!

Random notes to be elaborated on:
- the point method on c channels
- unlink parts when they are brought in
- sketches are useful for making joints (j hotkey)
- joints are useful for combining
- making planes to mirror by (midplane on a C channel)
- mirrored parts lose sketches
- make rigid body for wheels / motors
