# Refining Building Skill

An important part of making competition-level robots is reducing the possible room for error, looseness, etc... that results simply from building without the level of scrutiny that is necessary.

### What is 'Slop'?

'Slop' refers to building 'sloppily' - which could mean one or several of the following, for example:
- spacing between parts is not exact
- don't even know the right number of holes to use
- gears don't mesh with eachother perfectly
- connection is easily twisted apart
etc...

The key to reducing slop is to eliminate it's sources, one by one.

### 1. Know the Spacing

Knowing how much space should be in between parts is essential. Every length, dimension, and even weight is recorded, and for you to use. You can determine the exact lengths of parts [on the VEX site](https://www.vexrobotics.com/shafts-and-hardware.html) (see the description tab at the bottom), using a ruler, or by using [CAD](cad.md).
